# AI Programming with Python Project : Developing-an-AI-application
## Image Classifier

Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.

In this project, I have trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. Can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice one can train this classifier, then export it for use in any application. I've used dataset of 102 flower categories.

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.
